    "The first step of developing a machine learning model is to clearly understand and define the problem we want to solve. Here are some useful questions to ask. \n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, the dataset contains galaxy morphology labels (spiral and elliptical). Therefore, we can use supervised learning methods to utilise the labelled data.\n",

    "We want to classify galaxies by their morphology so this is a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What metric can be used to evaluate the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are performing classification, we can use a classification metric such as [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) to evaluate and quantify the performance of our model. Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified galaxies. As a challenge, we have been asked to develop a model that achieves â‰¥ 70% accuracy. Is this feasible? How can we find out?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can the question actually be answered with the available data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the dataset contains labels of the galaxy types we want to classify. i.e. `{spiral, elliptical}`. If we were asked to develop a model to detect other types of galaxies then we would need to collect data and labels for these other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there problem and application requirements we need to consider?\n",
    "\n",
    "How will the model be used after it has been developed? Are there requirements for the model to be used on specific devices? e.g. personal computers, smart phones, embedded systems and/or servers. For the purpose of this lesson, we can assume that it is fine to train and run the model on our personal computers. However, this may not always be the case and it is something to consider if we are required to deploy our models to systems with limited compute and memory resources (e.g. embedded systems). In these instances, we may be restricted to build small, less complex and fast models at the cost of reduced performance (e.g. accuracy).\n",
